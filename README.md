## Overview
This repository provides the official implementation for our paper: [Steering Your Diffusion Policy with Latent Space Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15799) (CoRL 2025).

Specifically, it contains a JAX-based implementation of DSRL (Diffusion Steering via Reinforcement Learning) for steering a pre-trained generalist policy, [π₀](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi), across various environments, including:

- **Simulation:** Libero, Aloha  
- **Real Robot:** Franka

## Installation
1. Create a conda environment:
```
conda create -n dsrl_pi0 python=3.11.11
conda activate dsrl_pi0
```

2. Clone this repo with all submodules
```
git clone git@github.com:nakamotoo/dsrl_pi0.git --recurse-submodules
cd dsrl_release
```

3. Install all packages and dependencies
```
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install "jax[cuda12]==0.5.0"

# install openpi
pip install -e openpi
pip install -e openpi/packages/openpi-client

# instal Libero
pip install -e LIBERO
pip install torch==2.6.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu # needed for libero
```

## Training (Simulation)
Libero
```
bash examples/scripts/run_libero.sh
```
Aloha
```
bash examples/scripts/run_aloha.sh
```
### Training Logs
We provide sample W&B runs and logs: https://wandb.ai/mitsuhiko/DSRL_pi0_public

## Training (Real)
For real-world experiments, we use the remote hosting feature from pi0 (see [here](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi/blob/main/docs/remote_inference.md)) which enables us to host the pi0 model on a higher-spec remote server, in case the robot's client machine is not powerful enough. 

0. Setup Franka robot install and DROID package [[link](https://github.com/droid-dataset/droid.git)]

1. [On the remote server] Host pi0 droid model on your remote server
```
cd openpi && python scripts/serve_policy.py --env=DROID
```
2. [On your robot client machine] Run DSRL
```
bash examples/scripts/run_real.sh
```
